Today I learned about cd,ls,touch,file,cat,less and history. It wasn't a lot. I hope I can finish this "linux" section as soon as possible. My main objective is now to finish 
grasshopper and networking nomads sections (recommended by ChatGPT).

Feels like there's a lot I can do with "cat" that I don't know yet.
