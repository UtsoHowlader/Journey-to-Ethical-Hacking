I'll be officially starting my Ethical Hacking journey. This Journey is not going to be smooth as I don't have any prior experiences. But I will try my best.

First, I'll be learning basic linux commands and how to use linux. I've heard that once I learn linux, it will get a little bit easier for me. After searching for some time,
I came across this website: https://labex.io/linuxjourney
it has hands-on lessons for me. It will be very helpful. I'll try to stick to this site for now and see how it goes.
